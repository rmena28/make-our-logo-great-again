[Make our logo great again](https://rmena-make-our-logo-great-again.netlify.app/)

##### Dependencies
- redux
- react-redux
##### Dev dependencies
- @types/react-router-dom
- redux-devtools-extension

----------

### Approach
This is a list of the approaches I used.
- All the components are functional components.
- The state management used was redux with hooks.
- TypeScript. 
- `React.MouseEvent` to handle Drag and Drop.
- A custom hook (`useRandomSortedData`) was created to handle the list of items.
- NO **DOM** modifications were made.
- **React Portal** was used to render a modal (to show the results).
- `react-router-dom` was used to handle the routing.
- No UI library was used.
